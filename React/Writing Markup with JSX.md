_JSX_ is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file. Although there are other ways to write components, most React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX, and most codebases use it.

## Converting HTML to JSX
Suppose that you have some (perfectly valid) HTML:

```HTML
<h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" alt="Hedy Lamarr" class="photo" />
<ul>
  <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
  <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
  <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>
</ul>

```

And you want to put it into your component:

```JSX
export default function TodoList() {
	return (//???
	)
}
```

If you copy and paste it as is, it will not work

## The Rules of JSX

### 1. Return a single root element
To return multiple elements from a component, **wrap them with a single parent tag.**

For example, you can use a `<div>`:
```HTML
<div>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</div>
```

If you don’t want to add an extra `<div>` to your markup, you can write `<>` and `</>` instead:

```HTML
<>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</>
```

This empty tag is called a _[Fragment.](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment)_ Fragments let you group things without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree.
#### Why do multiple JSX tags need to be wrapped?
 JSX looks like HTML, but under the hood it is transformed into plain JavaScript objects. 
You can’t return two objects from a function without wrapping them into an array.
 This explains why you also can’t return two JSX tags without wrapping them into another tag or a Fragment.
### 2. Close all the tags 
JSX requires tags to be explicitly closed: self-closing tags like `<img>` must become `<img />`, and wrapping tags like `<li>oranges` must be written as `<li>oranges</li>`.

This is how Hedy Lamarr’s image and list items look closed:
```HTML
<>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
   />
  <ul>
    <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
    <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
    <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>
  </ul>
</>
```

### 3. camelCase ~~all~~ most of the things!

JSX turns into JavaScript and attributes written in JSX become keys of JavaScript objects. In your own components, you will often want to read those attributes into variables. But JavaScript has limitations on variable names. For example, their names can’t contain dashes or be reserved words like `class`.

This is why, in React, many HTML and SVG attributes are written in camelCase. For example, instead of `stroke-width` you use `strokeWidth`. Since `class` is a reserved word, in React you write `className` instead, named after the [corresponding DOM property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className):

```HTML
<img 
  src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
  alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
  className="photo"
/>
```

### Pro-tip: Use a JSX Converter [](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx#pro-tip-use-a-jsx-converter "Link for Pro-tip: Use a JSX Converter")

Converting all these attributes in existing markup can be tedious! We recommend using a [converter](https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx) to translate your existing HTML and SVG to JSX. Converters are very useful in practice, but it’s still worth understanding what is going on so that you can comfortably write JSX on your own.

Here is your final result:
```JSX
export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
      <img 
        src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
        alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
        className="photo" 
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
        <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
        <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```
