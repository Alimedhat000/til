### 1. `lru_k_replacer.c` & `lru_k_replacer.h`

Implement a LRU_K policy  

What I Did :

- Added several helper functions In`LRUKNode` :
	- `RecordAccess(size_t timestamp)`:
		Pushes a new timestamp to the `history_` array, If the `history_` is full (size > k) then remove the oldest timestamp i.e.`pop_front`.
	
	- `IsHistoryFull() const`: 
		returns a `boolian` $size \space \ge \space k$
	
	- `GetLastAccess() const` :
		returns the newest timestamp
	
	- `GetKDistance(size_t current_timestamp)`:
		returns `infinity` if history is full else returns the difference between the newest timestamp and `current_timestamp` 
	
	- `is_evictable`: 
		This acts as the Pin discussed before making the current Node not evictable.
	
- In `LRUKReplacer`:
	- `Evict()` 
		this does two passes on the `node_store`:
		- First search frames with less than `K` accesses and evicts the newest one if found
		- Â If no frames with less than k accesses, find largest k-distance and evicts it
	
	- `RecordAccess(frame_id, access_type)`
		if the frame does not exist create one first and add to `node_store`, then add new timestamp to it
	
	- `SetEvictable(frame_id, set_evictable)`
		sets the evictable level to the node with `frame_id` and increases the `evictable_count` or decrease it depending on `set_evictable` value.
	
	- `Remove(frame_id)`
		removes specified frame id , If Remove is called on a non-evictable frame, throw an exception or abort the process. also decrement `evictable_items` if removal is successful. 


### 2. `page_guard.cpp`

This was the most complicated bit for me but here's the summary of the functions

First of all, WHAT THE HECK IS `Write/ReadPageGuard` ?? 
Take a step back and relax, i once was in your position and truly understand your frustration.

Basically, The `page_guard.cpp` module implements two RAII-style guards: `ReadPageGuard` and `WritePageGuard`, which manage access to pages in the buffer pool. These guards ensure safe access patterns (read or write) by acquiring appropriate locks and managing the lifecycle of pinned pages.

#### WHO is RAII??

**RAII** stands for **Resource Acquisition Is Initialization**. Itâ€™s a programming idiom in C++ that ties resource management to object lifetime.

A **RAII-style guard** is a class whose constructor **acquires a resource**, and whose destructor **automatically releases it**. This ensures that resources like memory, file handles, mutex locks, etc., are **safely and automatically cleaned up** when the guard object goes out of scopeâ€”no manual cleanup is needed.

#### Back To Our Implementation  

##### **1. `ReadPageGuard` Class**

###### **1.1 Purpose**

The `ReadPageGuard` class provides read-only access to a page while ensuring that:

- The shared read lock is held during the guardâ€™s lifetime, and the page remains pinned and is not evicted.

- Resources are automatically released when the guard is destroyed.

###### **1.2 Constructor**

```cpp
ReadPageGuard(page_id, frame, replacer, bpm_latch, disk_scheduler)
```

- Locks the page using a shared (`rwlatch_.lock_shared`) lock (Here used `lock_shared` because multiple queries can read the same frame at the same time), then marks the page/frame `valid` this ensures that it cannot be evicted.

###### **1.3 Move constructor**

The move constructors transfers ownership from one guard to another:

- Copies the internal state from the source guard.
    
- Moves pointers to shared resources (e.g., `frame_`, `replacer_`).
    
- Marks the source guard as **invalid**, preventing double-release or dangling resource access.

This allows guards to be passed or returned safely while preserving ownership semantics.
###### **1.4 Methods**

- `Flush()`: Safely flushes the page to disk via `DiskScheduler` using `std::promise`/`std::future` synchronization.
	Steps:
	1.  First check if the frame/page isn't valid assert.
	2. Acquire the `bpm_latch` to ensure thread safety from other DBMS classes.
	3. Create a promise to track the completion of the disk operation
	4. Schedule a write operation using `disk_scheduler`
	5. Wait for the promise to resolve.
	6. Then clear the dirty flag Yay !
    
- `Drop()`: Releases the read lock and decrements the pin count. If pin count drops to zero, the page becomes evictable.
	Steps:
	1. First check if the frame/page isn't valid assert.
	2. Now release the shared read lock we acquired in the constructor.
	3. Modify the pin count of the frame (need the `bpm_latch`)
	4. If the pin count drops to zero, mark the page as evictable via `replacer_->SetEvictable(...)`(LRU-K).
	5. Invalidate the guard by resetting all member fields to null or sentinel values.

#### **2. `WritePageGuard` Class**

###### **2.1 Purpose**

The `WritePageGuard` grants exclusive write access to a page:

- Acquires an **exclusive** lock using `rwlatch_.lock()`.
    
- Marks the page as dirty immediately.
    
- Handles eviction and cleanup similarly to `ReadPageGuard`.

###### **2.2 Constructor**

```cpp
WritePageGuard(page_id, frame, replacer, bpm_latch, disk_scheduler)
```

- Locks the page for **exclusive** access.
    
- Marks the page dirty to signal it needs flushing before eviction.

###### **2.3 Move Semantics**

Similar to `ReadPageGuard`, the move constructor:

- Transfers ownership of resources and state from the source guard.
    
- Marks the source as invalid to prevent resource duplication.
    
- Ensures that only one guard controls the page at a time.

###### **2.4 Methods**

- **`Flush()`**: Performs a thread-safe flush of dirty data to disk.
    Steps:
    1. Assert the guard is valid.    
    2. Lock `bpm_latch_` to prevent concurrent pin/eviction operations.
    3. Create a `std::promise<bool>` and obtain its `future`.
    4. Schedule a write via `disk_scheduler_`.
    5. Wait for the disk operation to complete.
    6. Reset the dirty flag.

- **`Drop()`**: Releases ownership and unpins the page.
    Steps:
    1. Return early if the guard is invalid.
    2. Unlock the exclusive write lock.
    3. Lock `bpm_latch_` and decrement `pin_count_`.
    4. If `pin_count_ == 0`, make the page evictable via the replacer.
    5. Reset all internal fields to mark the guard invalid.
