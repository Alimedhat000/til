Views are the user-facing part of the application, in this case, HTML files. We’ve dealt with views in an earlier project where the server would send HTML files to the user. These files are static, but many of our use cases require views to be dynamic w.r.t. data.

Hence, we use template engines to create our views. In this course, we will use [EJS](https://ejs.co/).
